		  <p>Yemen is a country that has been caught in a Civil war for about 6 years. This war has made the countryâ€™s sanitation very poor due to the fact that no city is safe and civilians are constantly on the move. The poor sanitation levels allow the virus to spread easily, thereby affecting lots of people and families. Also since there is no ceasefire in the war during the pandemic, many soldiers are increasingly prone to catching the virus. Also, only half of Yemen's population have access to running water. The other half, without running water, is more prone to being infected. </p>

            <p class="p_modal">Yemen had its first recorded case on April 10th 2020. Soon after, cases were spreading across the country like hot cakes. It was safe to predict that most of Yemen was going to drastically suffer due to the inability of international aid to enter the country easily. Currently, Yemen has about 2,000 active cases with about 1,000 recoveries and 500 deaths. It is also predicted that about half of Yemen's population will eventually contract COVID-19. Also most Toll passes to many provinces only have about 1 or 2 digital thermometers, and that too with hardly any spare batteries.
